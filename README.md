# Spanish Conversation Cards (A1 Level)

This is a simple project that displays Spanish conversation cards designed for A1 learners. The idea is to help users practice everyday conversation through short and easy prompts.

## 🧠 About This Project

I’m a beginner learning **React**, and I created this project to build my skills while making something useful for language learners.

The initial codebase was generated using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/59afa727-28ae-4e95-99f6-aab9a375557c), but the result was non-functional. I took it as a challenge to fix the issues and continue building on top of it to better understand React and related tools.

It’s my way of practicing:

- React fundamentals
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn-ui for reusable UI components
- Vite for fast development

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React**
